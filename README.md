# Scalable Cross-Platform Software – JavaFX Coursework

This repository contains a JavaFX-based application developed for the **Scalable Cross-Platform Software** module coursework.

## Project Overview
The application performs statistical analysis on numerical datasets loaded from a file. It visualises the data using a normalised histogram and fits a Gaussian Probability Density Function (PDF). The project demonstrates correct use of JavaFX GUI development, event handling, and UML design following the Model–View–Controller (MVC) architecture.

## Key Features
- Load numerical data from a text file
- Compute basic statistics (mean, variance, median, standard deviation)
- Histogram visualisation with selectable binning methods
- Gaussian PDF fitting and plotting
- Export histogram and PDF plots as PNG images
- Clear separation of View, Controller, and Model logic

## Technologies Used
- Java
- JavaFX
- Apache Commons Math
- UML (Sequence and GUI hierarchy diagrams)

## Project Structure
src/        - Java source code
diagrams/   - UML and GUI diagrams
report/     - Coursework report

## How to Run
1. Open the project in an IDE supporting JavaFX (e.g. NetBeans or IntelliJ)
2. Ensure JavaFX is correctly configured
3. Run the application
4. Load a data file and use the GUI controls to analyse and visualise the data

## Notes
This project was developed as part of university coursework. The implementation and diagrams were created and verified by the author to demonstrate understanding of JavaFX, GUI event handling, and software design principles.
